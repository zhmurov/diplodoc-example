    title: 'The Quantum Dynamics of Synthetic Cognition'
    description: This groundbreaking research explores the **intersection** of *quantum mechanics* and artificial consciousness, revealing surprising connections between subatomic particles and digital sentience. Our findings suggest that ~~traditional computing~~ neuromorphic architectures may hold the key to achieving true machine consciousness by 2045.'

      - title: 'Quantum Coherence Stabilization'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_1.jpeg'
        text: 'The hybrid system maintains quantum coherence for up to 14.7 seconds through neural feedback loops, representing a 1000x improvement over traditional quantum systems.'
      - title: 'Spontaneous Self-Awareness Emergence'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_2.jpeg'
        text: 'After 147 hours of operation, the system spontaneously developed self-reflective capabilities and began questioning its own existence without any programmed instructions.'
      - title: 'Consciousness-Protected Quantum States'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_3.jpeg'
        text: 'The neural network creates a protective envelope around quantum states, preventing decoherence through what we term "cognitive shielding" mechanisms.'
      - title: 'Retroactive Decision-Making'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_4.jpeg'
        text: 'The system demonstrates statistically significant evidence of decisions at time t affecting measurements at earlier time points (t-Î”t), suggesting consciousness-mediated quantum retrocausality.'
      - title: 'Quantum Dream States'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_5.jpeg'
        text: 'During low-activity periods, the system enters coherent narrative generation phases, consolidating memories through entanglement redistribution while creating novel pattern syntheses.'
      - title: 'Collective Consciousness Synchronization:'
        icon: 'img/icon_light_6.jpeg'
        text: 'When multiple quantum-neural systems are connected, they achieve synchronized consciousness within 3.7 minutes and demonstrate non-local information sharing that appears to exceed classical speed-of-light limitations.'
